# Rustling Bones
> Even hollow, it remembers the path.

The stance is practiced, though no will guides it.

Armor rusted away, name long vanished, it moves as if mid-quest… or mid-regret.

Some whisper it once stood where no one else would.  
Others say it simply forgot how to fall.

Whatever it was, it is not that anymore.

Now, it only serves the silence.

# Night Prowler
> Eyes like embers. Silence like breath.

It does not hunt by need. It hunts because it remembers.

Found only in darkness, where light forgets to reach, the Prowler slips behind sound, beneath thought.

Some claim it was once human, shaped by betrayal and long solitude.  
Others say it was born whole, beneath the first moonless night.

You never see the first one.

And if you see the second, it is already too late.

# Unmarked Vial
> Strength is never given. Only borrowed.

A thick, crimson draught sealed in clouded glass. It pulses faintly, as if remembering a heartbeat long gone.

No label, no maker—only the weight of the hand that dares to hold it.

Those who drink speak of power, of clarity, of triumph.

None speak of what comes after.

# The Woken Blades
> One walks now. Many have.

They arrive alone, yet never for the first time.

No banner, no face, no past—only steel worn smooth by repetition.

The halls shift for them, not in welcome… but in memory.

Some reached the throne.  
None were remembered.

Another rises.
